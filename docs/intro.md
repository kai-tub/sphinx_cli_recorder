# Welcome to the Sphinx-CLI-Recorder documentation!

- No need to manually record a terminal session

Why better than GIF's
- Allows directly copying from a terminal session
- Configurable play-back
- Smaller file sizes without losing resolution
- No binary dependency

```{record_cli_cmd} python -m sphinx_cli_recorder.testing.animation_example
:autoplay: "True"
```
